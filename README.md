# WEATHER-DATA-USING-API
This is a Real-Time weather data fetching python program using python API. In this program it will fetch the weather data of the particular location using an 'API KEY'. To do that first of all we must create our own API KEY and also we cannot use others in this case. I have created my own API KEY and executed the program which fetches all the weather details like Humidity, Wind speed, Temperature etc of the location I have provided. So you can find my code here and use it as reference to make your own Real-Time Weather Data fetching python program using an API KEY.  :))
